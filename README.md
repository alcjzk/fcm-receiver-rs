# fcm-receiver

## FCM web-push receiver implementation for Rust.

This crate is a port of [MatthieuLemoine/push-receiver](https://github.com/MatthieuLemoine/push-receiver) into Rust, made for a
personal project. It uses deprecated legacy endpoints and a
hardcoded server-key originating from the aforementioned repository. Please consider using
another alternative like [fcm-push-listener](https://crates.io/crates/fcm-push-listener).
